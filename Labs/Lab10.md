# Photogrammetry

Photogrammetry is a fairly simple process that combines multiple 2D photos into a 3D model. In paleontology, photogrammetry is used by museum curators to build 3D models of specimens in their collections, by researchers to study mophology in three dimensions, and by field scientists to create virtual models and maps of field sites. And while photogrammetry has been around for a while, people are rapidly developing new and exciting applications for the process. Learning the basics of photogrammetry will add a useful tool to your paleo research toolkit.

The following resources will help you through the photogrammetry process:

## Instructions

For the final lab of this course, you will be building your own 3D model of a specimen from the WWU Paleo Collections.

### Step 1: Pick A Specimen

During class, choose a specimen from the teaching collections housed in ES 227. You may choose any specimen regardless of taxonomy, size or preservation, but keep in mind that larger specimens will require more photos and longer processing time. We can discuss the pros and cons of different specimens during class.

### Step 2: Photography

Photogrammetry uses a suite of 2D photos to build a 3D model. To do so, photographs should be taken under controlled conditions. This means that specimens should be well-lit by ambient light, a scalebar and photogrammetry targets should be visible in every shot, and photos should be taken from roughly the same distance without any zoom or flash.

We will use a special photogrammetry rig that I have built in the classroom to photograph our specimens. I will explain the rig and how to take usable photos during class.

After you have taken a complete set of photos, save them to an online folder so that you can access them from a computer in the computer lab.

### Step 3: Agisoft Photoscan

Build your model in Agisoft Photoscan following the instructions in this guide: [A Guide to Processing Photos into 3D Models using Agisoft Photoscan](http://www.stporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photoscan_Instructions_Complete_Fall2015.pdf). ***This will take a lot of time so budget accordingly!***

### Step 4: Export Your Model

When you have completed your model, export the file as a `.obj` file. This will actually produce three files, a `.obj`, a `.mtl` and a `.jpg`. Upload all three of these files to Canvas to submit your final product. I will then upload your file to Sketchfab, a website that hosts 3D files. I will share all the files with the class that you can all see each other's final products!
