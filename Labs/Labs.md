# Laboratory Assignments

This course will begin with an introduction to programming in R designed by Andrew Zaffos. The links for Labs 1-4 take you directly to his tutorial pages. When completing those labs, please disregard the instructions and links to test that he has included in the introductions and use the links provided here (because the quizzes are different). Direct links to each lab and quiz are also provided on the course's Canvas site, so you can always check there if you are unsure about assignments or due dates.
