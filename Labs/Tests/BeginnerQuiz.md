## Loading in Data

We will be using several pre-built datasets that come with R. You can load them into R using the ````data( )```` function.

````R
# Data from the 1974 Motor Trends US magazine
> data(mtcars)

# The body temperature series of a beaver
> data(beaver1)

# Areas of the world's major landmasses
> data(islands)
````

Note that you would normally need to define the name of new objects using the ````<-```` operator, but the ````data( )```` function creates a new object for you automatically.

# Take a quick look at the structure of each dataset
# You can use the head( ) function to only display the first few rows of each dataset

**PROBLEM SET 1**

1. What **class** of object is ````mtcars````? What function did you use to find out?

2. Is ````islands```` defined as a **1-dimensional array** or a **vector**? How did you find out?

3. How would you convert the data.frame ````beaver1```` into a matrix?

4. What is the name of the 8th landmass in the ````islands```` dataset? How did you find out?

5. What function would you use if you wanted to combine all three datasets into a single object?

6. Does ````islands```` consist of numeric data? How did you find out?

7. Code **four** different ways to **subscript** the **2nd row** and **7th column** of ````mtcars```` using bracket notation. (Hint: You are looking to return the number 17.02)

8. How would you change the landmass values of "Iceland", "Kyushu", and "Tierra del Fuego" to 82, 21, and 10 in the ````islands```` dataset? (Hint: You will need to use **subscripts** and the ````<-```` operator).

9. Are there any times when the beaver in the ````beaver1```` dataset had a temperature lower than 36.30 degrees? How did you find out?

10. Take the sum of all elements in the column **temp** in the ````beaver1```` dataset and call this value **ValueA**. Take the sume of all elements in the row **Valiant** in the ````mtcars```` dataset and call this value **ValueB**. Take the sum of the first **7 elements** of the ````islands```` dataset and call this value **ValueC**. Divide **ValueC** by **ValueB** and add **ValueA**. What is your final answer? Show your code.
